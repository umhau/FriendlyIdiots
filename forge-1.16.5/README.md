# The Modpacks of the Friendly Idiots

There's multiple variations, because we're extra.

## Step 1
Install Forge.

## Step 2
Pick a modpack, download it, and put the contents in `AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods`.  Remember to remove all other mods from the folder. (You can put them in a subfolder.)

## Step 3
Fire up minecraft & enjoy!

# Mods List for FI-Modded

Because that's the one getting ALL THE MODS dumped in it. 

General philosophy: do not increase the complexity of the world. Crafting should still be relatively simple - no crazy complex recipes. Do not make it hard to survive, and do not give the appearance of a zoo.  Everything should feel natural (fully integrated) and well built.

## TODO

- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/villagers-follow-emeralds
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ice-and-fire-dragonseeker
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/structures-compass Good tool to have. Post recipe.
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dwarf
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/art-artillery Not sure if this is desirable, but it is a multiplayer mod.
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ring-of-repair-forge Seems a little OP, but with the additional dangers it seems needed. Post recipe.
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gobber Wanted for two specific items: ring of teleport, ring of stealth. If they need special ores, then make them show up in chests and disable the recipes.

### Vanilla ++
(Stuff that could pass as original)

- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ice-ice-baby Another Illager mob
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chicken-drop-feathers Improved chickens
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/faster-ladder-climbing Or this: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gotta-climb-fast. 
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mermaid-tail-mod Because it's fun. Post recipe.
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/let-sleeping-dogs-lie Client side only. But still.



### More mobs

- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lava-monsters/screenshots Not super convincing, but cute.
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/eyes-in-the-darkness Good for the horror factor
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/weeping-angels-mod with proper config, to cut down on the spawn rate (see comment: these should be a rare and powerful enemy, not a defining factor of the world).
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/camels
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fantasy-mounts Make sure there's no duplicate animals. Seems a little buggy - test frostwalking.


### Structures

- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/adventures-structures/screenshots There's some dumb stuff in here, see if some of them can be disabled.
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extractures/ 
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/castle-in-the-sky-the-fairytale-of-laputa This also adds some interesting mechanics. Make sure it works with multiplayer. Add a note to trade for the cloud stone?
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/when-dungeons-arise Some of these are GIGANTIC. Make sure they're configured properly.

### Fabric only

- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/doors-of-infinity Forge version requires optifine & immersive portals.
