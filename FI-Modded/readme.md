# The Land of Id
## Modpack + Server

Welcome to the land of Id! Here you will find deep halls and precious hordes, fantastic beasts and the means to find them, mechanical marvels of soaring complexity and a secluded valley respite.  Do not tarry in the dark, for the night is deep and full of horrors.

There are friendly peoples in the land of Id and these Id-ians are found in many forms and places. Search for friends, and you will find them; expect enemies, and you will make them. Beware the inhabitants which destroy you easily.  Do not take your health or armament for granted; do not enter conflict without forethought. Beware the unassuming foe.

There are many tools to aid your endeavors. Search the inventory assistant for recipes. 
- Backpacks. These require a modification to the default controls (`esc -> controls -> backpack`). 
- Grappling hooks. There are many high places, and enemies against which mobility is a great asset.
- Weapons. Still medieval, but greater in scope and power. Arrows are now cheaper to obtain.
- Mechanical production. The Create mod, the Construction Wand, and Carry On.
- The Beastiary and the Animal Dictionary. These will teach you many of the creatures of this new world.

## Installation

This is a Forge modpack.  Download [here](https://github.com/umhau/FriendlyIdiots/releases/download/v0.2/FI-Modded.zip).

Put these files in `AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods`. Later, I'll separate the serverside mods from the rest. For now, just dump the pile.
