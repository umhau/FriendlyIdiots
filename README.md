# The Modpacks of the Friendly Idiots

There's multiple variations, because we're extra.

## Step 1
Install Forge.

## Step 2
Pick a modpack, download it, and put the contents in `AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods`.  Remember to remove all other mods from the folder. (You can put them in a subfolder.)

## Step 3
Fire up minecraft & enjoy!

# Mods List for FI-Modded

Because that's the one getting ALL THE MODS dumped in it. 

General philosophy: do not increase the complexity of the world. 

Crafting should still be relatively simple - no crazy complex recipes. Do not make it hard to survive, and do not give the appearance of a zoo.  Everything should feel natural (fully integrated) and well built.

## Currently Installed

#### Ice and Fire
Because DRAGONS!
#### Create
Added because That Guy wants it.
#### Just Enough Items
See what the recipes are.
#### Waystones
Teleportation _au natural_! And it's integrated with the towers of the wild.
